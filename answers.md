## Searching Answers

1. 
    1. Five of diamonds found in the seventh spot.
    2. Five of diamonds found in the fifth spot, after searching only 2 cards.
    3. Binary was faster because it narrowed the window to search for an item.

2. An algorithm is more efficient the faster it can locate an item within a list of data. In my experiment, binary searching was more efficient because it had to check less items to find the target.

3. 
    1. Regular search goes through each item of the list beginning at "apple" to see if it equals "blueberry", returning -1 at the end because it does not exist. 
    Binary Search would begin at "lime", and because "blueberry" comes before it alphabetically, the search would take the first half of the list and look at "banana", "blueberry" comes after so it narrows the search to "cherry" and "lemon", seeing as which neither is the target it then returns -1.
    2. Search looked at all 11 items, Binary Search looked at 4 items.
    3. Search would have looked at all 1000 items, and Binary search would look at about 10 items.


## Sorting Answers

1. 
    1. Going through the cards 8 times to sort.
    2. Made 11 swaps to sort the list.
    3. 6 Passes made.
    4. From my experiments, InsertionSort and BubbleSort are both more efficient than the SelectionSort, however it's hard to tell whether Insertion or Bubble Sorts are more efficient.

2. 
    1. For SelectionSort it would take 90 comparisons, InsertionSort would take 9, and BubbleSort would take 9.
    2. SelectionSort would take 90, InsertionSort would take 45, BubbleSort would take 90.
    3. SelectionSort would take 90, 900, 9000. Insertion Sort would take less, and BubbleSort would be somewhere in between.

3. Binary is exponentially faster than Selection searching so sorting would be worth it especially with huge lists.
